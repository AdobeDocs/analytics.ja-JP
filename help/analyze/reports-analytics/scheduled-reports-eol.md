# End-of-life notice for scheduled reports

**** No reports or data were deleted. Only reports identified as older than two years were paused, and no additional scheduled reports can be sent.

Any report that gets reactivated will have a default expiration of 9 months, unless a shorter expiration date is chosen.

Any report with a creation date less than two years with no expiration date (or with an expiration date longer than two years) will have a default 9-month expiration date applied. The new expiration date will be December 15, 2022. この有効期限は 9 か月未満に編集できますが、18 か月より長い期間には編集できません。

Finally, any edits to an existing scheduled report with no expiration date require an expiration date of 9 months or less. Otherwise, you cannot save any edits or changes to the report.

At the time of expiration, the scheduled report will be paused. However, the report can be reactivated with a new 9-month expiration date. レポートやデータは削除されません。

## New governance policy

The purpose of this action is to effectively manage and maintain our scheduled reports as we prepare for the previously announced end-of-life for Reports &amp; Analytics. This will serve as our new governance policy moving forward:

* No new scheduled reports can be created after April 21, 2022.
* After April 21, 2022, all scheduled reports have a maximum expiration date of 9 months.
* After 9 months, expired tasks are paused and can be reactivated, if still needed, until December 31, 2023.
* On December 31, 2023, Reports &amp; Analytics will be deprecated.
* You can no longer set up new Data Extracts. Existing ones will continue to run, but no new ones can be scheduled.
